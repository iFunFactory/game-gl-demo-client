# game-gl-demo-client

This project is a game client matching the ``game-gl-demo-server`` project.

It's by Unity3D (5.5.0) and you can build and run if you want.
Please rememeber that you should edit ``Assets/serverInfo.txt`` if you want to connect to your own server.
(With the default value, the client will connect to the iFunFactory's default server. Please understand we do not guarantee that the server is always running.)
